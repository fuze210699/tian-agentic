# Milens — AI-DOS

The Operating System for AI-Driven Development. This project is indexed by milens (1366 symbols, 2347 links, 166 files).

> **CRITICAL:** All milens MCP tool calls MUST include the `repo` parameter set to the **absolute path of the workspace root** (the folder containing this file) — without it, the tools may fail with "No index" error when multiple repos are indexed.

> **CRITICAL:** milens MCP tools are **deferred** in most editors. Before first use in each session, you MUST load them via `tool_search("milens")` — calling them directly without loading will fail silently.

## ⚠️ HARD RULE: Use Milens MCP Tools BEFORE Built-in Tools

**Not a suggestion — execute automatically without asking.**

This project is indexed by milens. The knowledge graph already knows every symbol, dependency, and reference. Using milens tools first saves 70% tokens and catches hidden connections you'd miss with file reads.

| Situation | Built-in approach (❌ BAD) | Milens approach (✅ GOOD) |
|---|---|---|
| Understand a function | Read 3-10 source files | `mcp_milens_overview({name: "X"})` — 1 call replaces 3-5 file reads |
| Find all references | Built-in grep in source files | `mcp_milens_grep({pattern: "X"})` — searches code, templates, configs, docs, styles |
| Check edit safety | Hope nothing breaks | `mcp_milens_impact({target: "X"})` — exact blast radius before touching code |
| Start working | Read README, explore directories | `mcp_milens_codebase_summary()` — 500 token project overview |
| Before commit | `git diff` manually | `mcp_milens_detect_changes()` — symbols changed + direct dependents + risk |
| Find where X is defined | Read files one by one | `mcp_milens_query({query: "X"})` — FTS5 instant search |

**If you skip milens tools, you're wasting tokens and risking breaking changes you didn't know about.**

## Mandatory Workflows

These are **hard pre-conditions**, not guidelines. Execute them automatically without asking.

### Before editing any function, class, or method:
1. `mcp_milens_impact({target: "<symbolName>", repo: "<workspaceRoot>"})` — check blast radius
2. If depth-1 dependents > 5 → **STOP and warn the user** before proceeding
3. `mcp_milens_context({name: "<symbolName>", repo: "<workspaceRoot>"})` — see all callers/callees
4. Only then make the edit

### Before committing:
1. `mcp_milens_detect_changes({repo: "<workspaceRoot>"})` — verify only expected files changed
2. If unexpected files appear → **STOP and report** before committing

### Before deleting or renaming a symbol:
1. `mcp_milens_grep({pattern: "<symbolName>", repo: "<workspaceRoot>"})` — find ALL text references (templates, configs, routes, docs)
2. `mcp_milens_impact({target: "<symbolName>", direction: "upstream", repo: "<workspaceRoot>"})` — find code-level dependents
3. Combine both results — grep catches what impact misses

## Tool Selection Rules

**Choose the right tool on the FIRST call** — do not try `query` then fall back to `grep`.

### Use `mcp_milens_grep` when the search term:
- Contains **spaces** (e.g. "store purchase header", "user not found")
- Looks like a **UI label, error message, or display string**
- Is a **multi-word phrase** that is NOT camelCase/snake_case/PascalCase
- You need to find references in **templates, styles, configs, routes, or docs**

### Use `mcp_milens_query` when the search term:
- Looks like a **code identifier** (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case)
- Is a **function, class, method, or interface name**
- You want to find **symbol definitions** in indexed code files

### When in doubt → use `mcp_milens_grep` first
`grep` searches everything. `query` only searches indexed symbol definitions.

> **⚠️ `mcp_milens_grep` default is LITERAL mode (isRegex: false).** Characters `| . * + ?` are escaped as plain text. To use regex patterns like `error|fail|panic` or `TODO.*urgent`, you MUST set `isRegex: true`. The tool will warn you if you forget.

## Annotation Guide — Building a Smarter Codebase

Every time you discover something important about a symbol, annotate it. The system learns across sessions — your note today saves tokens tomorrow.

### When to annotate:
- Found a bug pattern? → `mcp_milens_annotate({symbol: "X", key: "bug", value: "..."})`
- Discovered an architecture rule? → `mcp_milens_annotate({symbol: "X", key: "architecture", value: "..."})`
- Learned how to test something? → `mcp_milens_annotate({symbol: "X", key: "test", value: "..."})`
- Found a security issue? → `mcp_milens_annotate({symbol: "X", key: "security", value: "..."})`
- Noted a hidden dependency? → `mcp_milens_annotate({symbol: "X", key: "dependency", value: "..."})`

### Annotation keys reference:
| Key | Use when | Example value |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| `bug` | Known bug, not yet fixed | "NullPointerException when users is empty array" |
| `security` | Security vulnerability | "No CSRF token validation on this endpoint" |
| `architecture` | Design pattern, constraint | "Service is a singleton — don't instantiate directly" |
| `test` | Testing knowledge | "Must mock Database.getConnection() before testing" |
| `dependency` | Hidden coupling | "Imports from deprecated module old-auth.js" |
| `refactor` | Future refactoring notes | "Split into validateEmail() + normalizeEmail()" |
| `workflow` | Process knowledge | "Must restart dev server after modifying this file" |
| `note` | General observation | "This function is called from cron job at 3AM" |

### Learning lifecycle:
1. **Session 1:** `annotate()` → confidence 0.5
2. **Session 2:** `recall()` sees it again → confidence 0.7
3. **Session 5:** confidence hits 0.8 → `milens evolve` promotes it to SKILL.md

### Annotate triggers:
| User says... | Tool call |
|---|---|
| "found a bug in X" | `mcp_milens_annotate({symbol: "X", key: "bug", value: "describe the bug"})` |
| "X has a security issue" | `mcp_milens_annotate({symbol: "X", key: "security", value: "describe the issue"})` |
| "learned how X works" | `mcp_milens_annotate({symbol: "X", key: "note", value: "key insight"})` |
| "X depends on Y internally" | `mcp_milens_annotate({symbol: "X", key: "dependency", value: "depends on Y for Z"})` |
| "X needs refactoring later" | `mcp_milens_annotate({symbol: "X", key: "refactor", value: "plan"})` |

### At session end, ALWAYS:
1. `mcp_milens_recall({})` — review annotations you found useful
2. `mcp_milens_annotate({symbol: "X", key: "...", value: "..."})` — save new discoveries from this session

## Problem → Solution — When You're Stuck

| You're trying to... | Do this FIRST |
|---|---|
| Understand the codebase | `mcp_milens_codebase_summary()` then `mcp_milens_domains()` |
| Understand a specific function | `mcp_milens_context({name: "functionName"})` |
| Find where something is defined | `mcp_milens_query({query: "ClassName"})` |
| Find ALL references to something | `mcp_milens_grep({pattern: "ClassName"})` |
| Check if editing is safe | `mcp_milens_impact({target: "functionName"})` |
| Edit with confidence | `mcp_milens_overview({name: "functionName"})` — context+impact+grep in 1 call |
| Know which tests to run | `mcp_milens_test_impact()` — maps changes to test files |
| Find what needs testing most | `mcp_milens_test_coverage_gaps()` — sorted by risk |
| Get a test strategy | `mcp_milens_test_plan({name: "functionName"})` — mocks + scenarios |
| Review your changes | `mcp_milens_review_pr()` — risk scores for changed symbols |
| Check for security issues | `mcp_milens_security_scan()` — 50+ rules in one call |
| Remove dead code safely | `mcp_milens_find_dead_code()` then use `dead_code_remove` prompt |
| Trace how code executes | `mcp_milens_trace({name: "functionName", direction: "to"})` |
| Find API endpoints | `mcp_milens_routes()` — auto-detect across 7 frameworks |
| See class hierarchy | `mcp_milens_get_type_hierarchy({name: "ClassName"})` |
| Compare impact before/after | `mcp_milens_compare_impact({name: "X", action: "snapshot"})` before, then `compare` after |
| Get a full picture fast | `mcp_milens_orchestrate()` — runs detect+review+impact+gaps+dead code |
| Remember something important | `mcp_milens_annotate({symbol: "X", key: "...", value: "..."})` |
| Recall past knowledge | `mcp_milens_recall({symbol: "X"})` |
| Start a new session properly | `mcp_milens_session_start({agent: "..."})` → `mcp_milens_recall()` → `mcp_milens_codebase_summary()` |
| End a session properly | `mcp_milens_detect_changes()` → `mcp_milens_review_pr()` → annotate → `mcp_milens_session_end()` |
| Transfer work to another agent | `mcp_milens_handoff({from_session: "...", to_agent: "...", context: "..."})` |
| Debug a crash / exception | `mcp_milens_trace({name: "crashingFunction"})` + `mcp_milens_context()` + `mcp_milens_impact()` |

## Session Lifecycle

### Start EVERY session:
1. `mcp_milens_session_start({agent: "your-agent-name"})` — register session
2. `mcp_milens_recall({})` — what did we learn last time?
3. `mcp_milens_codebase_summary()` — refresh project context in 500 tokens

### End EVERY session:
1. `mcp_milens_detect_changes()` — verify changes
2. `mcp_milens_review_pr()` — risk assessment
3. `mcp_milens_annotate({...})` — save key discoveries from this session
4. `mcp_milens_session_end({session_id: "..."})` — record stats

Milens indexes **Markdown files** (.md, .mdx) — headings become `section` symbols with parent-child hierarchy, and local links become cross-file references.

### Researching or exploring documentation:
1. `mcp_milens_get_file_symbols({file: "README.md", repo: "<workspaceRoot>"})` — see the full heading outline (TOC) of any doc
2. `mcp_milens_query({query: "<topic>"})` — search section headings across all docs and code
3. `mcp_milens_grep({pattern: "<keyword>", include: "**/*.md"})` — text search within docs only

### Before updating documentation:
1. `mcp_milens_get_file_symbols({file: "<doc.md>"})` — understand document structure first
2. If documenting a code symbol: `mcp_milens_context({name: "<symbolName>"})` — get full symbol info (signature, callers, deps)
3. `mcp_milens_grep({pattern: "<symbolName>", include: "**/*.md"})` — check if other docs already reference it

### After renaming/deleting a code symbol:
- `mcp_milens_grep({pattern: "<oldName>", include: "**/*.md"})` — find docs that need updating (milens indexes markdown links as cross-file references)

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a symbol without first running `mcp_milens_impact` on it.
- NEVER delete or rename without running both `mcp_milens_grep` and `mcp_milens_impact`.
- NEVER commit without running `mcp_milens_detect_changes()`.
- NEVER call milens MCP tools without the `repo` parameter.
- NEVER use `mcp_milens_query` for multi-word display text or UI labels — use `mcp_milens_grep`.
